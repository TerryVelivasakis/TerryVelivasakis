I've been home labbing for over 3 years now but I haven't been documenting my projects online.  I am in the process of converting my notebooks to repositories so I can be able to better document my process and methods

## Goals

I want to be a cloud solutions architect.  I really enjoy the challenge of finding solutions to complex problems, especially those faced by small businesses.  Coming from a deeply analitical background in real estate investment, I feel that my skills are suited perfectly for this new pursuit.  


## Exam Prep

# Network+

I'm studying like crazy for the Network+ exam and am struggling with memorizing common ports.  I wrote a python script to help with that.  It takes the list of common ports from the compTIA network+ objectives and gives the protocol asking for the port number.  It keeps a running tally of your correct guesses and will not repeat a port for at least 10 questions.
